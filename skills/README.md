# Skills
Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that Antigravity loads dynamically to improve performance on specialized tasks. Skills teach Antigravity how to complete specific tasks in a repeatable way, whether that's creating documents with your company's brand guidelines, analyzing data using your organization's specific workflows, or automating personal tasks.


# About This Repository
These skills range from creative applications (art, music, design) to technical tasks (testing web apps, MCP server generation) to enterprise workflows (communications, branding, etc.).

Each skill is self-contained in its own folder with a `SKILL.md` file containing the instructions and metadata. Browse through these skills to get inspiration for your own skills or to understand different patterns and approaches.

Many skills in this repo are open source (Apache 2.0). We've also included the document creation & editing skills that power  under the hood in the [`skills/docx`](./skills/docx), [`skills/pdf`](./skills/pdf), [`skills/pptx`](./skills/pptx), and [`skills/xlsx`](./skills/xlsx) subfolders. These are source-available, not open source, but we wanted to share these with developers as a reference for more complex skills that are actively used in a production AI application.

## Disclaimer

**These skills are provided for demonstration and educational purposes only.** While some of these capabilities may be available in Antigravity, the implementations and behaviors you receive from Antigravity may differ from what is shown in these skills. These skills are meant to illustrate patterns and possibilities. Always test skills thoroughly in your own environment before relying on them for critical tasks.

# Skill Sets

- [./spec](./spec): The Agent Skills specification
- [./template](./template): Skill template



After installing the plugin, you can use the skill by just mentioning it. For instance, if you install the `document-skills` plugin from the marketplace, you can ask Antigravity to do something like: "Use the PDF skill to extract the form fields from `path/to/some-file.pdf`"


# Creating a Basic Skill

Skills are simple to create - just a folder with a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter and instructions. You can use the **template-skill** in this repository as a starting point:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: A clear description of what this skill does and when to use it
---

# My Skill Name

[Add your instructions here that Antigravity will follow when this skill is active]

## Examples
- Example usage 1
- Example usage 2

## Guidelines
- Guideline 1
- Guideline 2
```

The frontmatter requires only two fields:
- `name` - A unique identifier for your skill (lowercase, hyphens for spaces)
- `description` - A complete description of what the skill does and when to use it

The markdown content below contains the instructions, examples, and guidelines that Antigravity will follow.

# Partner Skills

Skills are a great way to teach Antigravity how to get better at using specific pieces of software. As we see awesome example skills from partners, we may highlight some of them here:
